# FastAPI Project

This is a FastAPI project using Python 3.11, PostgreSQL, and Git.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```

git clone https://github.com/AnwarHossainSR/python-fast-api.git

```

Change directory to the project directory:

```

cd <your-project-name>

```

Install the required dependencies:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Create a new PostgreSQL database for the project:

```

createdb <your-database-name>

```

Update environment variable in the `.env` file :

```

DATABASE_HOSTNAME=
DATABASE_PORT=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
DATABASE_NAME=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
SECRET_KEY=
ALGORITHM=
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=


```

Migrate the database:

```

alembic upgrade head

```

Start the development server:

```

uvicorn main:app --reload

```

## Database Migration

To migrate the database, run the following command:

```

alembic upgrade head

This will create any new tables or columns that are required by the database schema, and update any existing tables or columns.

## Usage

To use the API, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. You will see a list of all of the available endpoints.

To make a request to an endpoint, click on the "Try it out" button and enter the required parameters. Then, click on the "Execute" button.

The response from the API will be displayed in the "Response body" section.
